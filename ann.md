# Approximate Nearest Neighbor

**Approximate Nearest Neighbor**, as a form of proximity search, is the [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point. Closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function: the less similar the objects, the larger the function values.
